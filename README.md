# 📊 Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes a Netflix dataset to uncover insights about movie durations, genres, and trends from specific decades. Built as part of a DataCamp project, it focuses on:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix titles.
- Filtering and analyzing movies from the 1990s.
- Identifying the most frequent movie durations.
- Counting short action movies (<90 minutes) from the 1990s.
- Visualizing results using `matplotlib`.
